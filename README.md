# Cybersecurity Code Assistant
This project is an intelligent chatbot interface that accepts code snippets and GitHub links as input. It utilizes Gemini's Large Language Model (LLM) to detect Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities within the code and provides corresponding fixes.

## Features
* Code Input: Accepts code snippets in multiple programming languages.
* GitHub Link Input: Can analyze code directly from a provided GitHub repository link.
* CWE Vulnerability Detection: Identifies potential security weaknesses based on the CWE framework.
* Automated Fix Suggestions: Suggests fixes for the detected vulnerabilities using Gemini's LLM.
* Multi-language Support: Supports multiple programming languages for vulnerability analysis.

## Technologies Used (Dependencies)
### Frontend:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For building a clean and responsive user interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot easily.
* React.js: For creating a dynamic and interactive UI, handling real-time user input, and providing smooth communication with the backend.

### Backend:
* Node.js: For handling server-side operations, managing requests, and processing code snippets or GitHub links submitted by users.
* Express.js (for Node.js): For creating APIs that handle the communication between the frontend and the LLM or GitHub repository analysis features.

### AI/LLM Integration:
* Gemini API: To perform vulnerability detection in code, provide explanations, and suggest fixes.

### Code Analysis and Security Tools:
* GitHub API: For integrating the chatbot with GitHub repositories, allowing automated scanning and analysis of entire codebases.

## Future Enchancement
Further we can fine-tune the model or use RAG to increase the accuracy of the model.
